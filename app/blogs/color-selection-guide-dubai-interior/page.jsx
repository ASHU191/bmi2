  <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">Any interior design project in Dubai or anywhere in the UAE is incomplete without selecting the right colors. At BMI Interior, we believe that understanding color psychology is essential before beginning any commercial or residential interior design work. Elements such as structure, 3D models, 2D drawings, sizes, measurements, furnishings, materials, interior fit-out services, execution, and technical details are all incomplete without the presence of color, which brings the entire vision to life.</p>
  
  <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">When designing spaces across the UAE, it’s important to consider key factors like room size, artificial and natural lighting, and overall sunlight exposure when choosing your color palette. Whether it's paint, wallpaper, flooring, ceiling finishes, door colors, or accessories—color selection plays a crucial role in shaping the ambiance of your spaces. The color theme you choose defines the identity and character of your space. It adds beauty and creates a soothing environment.</p>
  
  <p className="text-gray-300 mb-4">In every project by BMI Interior, we ensure that color enhances flexibility, comfort, and aesthetic value—whether we are working with deep, bold tones or soft, neutral shades. Color does more than please the eye—it can improve mental well-being, elevate your mood, and positively impact your health. With the right color choices, your interiors can feel more energetic, calm, luxurious, or dynamic—depending on your needs and lifestyle.</p>
